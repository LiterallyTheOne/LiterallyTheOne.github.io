* To address URL canonicalization issues, it is recommended to select a primary URL for your webpage and set up
  redirects from all other variations to the preferred one.
* To improve the website experience for your visitors, it is recommended to eliminate any render-blocking resources on
  this webpage.
* Using images in a modern format can significantly reduce the file size and improve the loading speed of a webpage,
  providing a better user experience and potentially increasing engagement.
* Connect your webpage with social media networks using APIs or AddThis, as social signals are becoming increasingly
  important for search engines to validate a site's trustworthiness and authority.
* Serve properly sized images to reduce page loading times and to improve user's experience.
* Without an SPF record, spammers can easily spoof emails from this domain, potentially leading to compromised email
  security and deliverability issues.

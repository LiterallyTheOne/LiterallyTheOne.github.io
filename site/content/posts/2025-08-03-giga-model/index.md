# Model with all its preprocesses and transforms

## Introduction

Today, I was planning to give other models a try.
Each model requires its own preprocesses, train_transforms, and validation_transforms.
I think of the steps of a deep learning project as below:

![deep_learning](deep_learning.drawio.svg)

So, in this way of thinking, the model has no idea about preprocessing
and transforms before it.
Which is a really great and modular way to think about that.
But when you want to try different approaches, it is a little bit troublesome.

## My Approach

To solve this problem, I have defined a class called `GigaModel`.
This model consists of `preprocessors`, `train_transforms`, `validation_transforms`.
It is like a bundle, and in the future, when I look at the charts, I can
track the approach that I used way better.
So, the method looks like something below:

![giga_model](giga_model.drawio.svg)

The code for it is like below:

```python
class GigaModel:
    def __init__(
            self,
            cfg: DictConfig,
            device: str = "cuda",
            checkpoint_path: Path = None,
    ):
        self.cfg = cfg
        self.device = device
        self.checkpoint_path = checkpoint_path

        self.model = self.get_model()
        self.model = self.prepare_model(self.model)

        self.prs = self.get_prs()
        self.train_transforms = self.get_train_transforms()
        self.val_transforms = self.get_val_transforms()
        self.target_transform = self.get_target_transform()

    def get_model(self):
        model = TransformerTCN.from_config(self.cfg)
        return model

    def prepare_model(self, model: nn.Module) -> nn.Module:
        model = model.to(self.device)
        if self.checkpoint_path is not None:
            model.load_state_dict(torch.load(self.checkpoint_path))
            print("^" * 10, "checkpoint loaded")
        return model

    def get_prs(self) -> list[Callable]:

        prs = [
            DropUnnecessaryColumns.from_config(self.cfg),
            FillNulls.from_config(self.cfg),
            ShrinkSequence.from_config(self.cfg),
            SortData.from_config(self.cfg),
            AddGlobalFeatures.from_config(self.cfg),
            AddMagnitude.from_config(self.cfg),
            NormalizeScaler.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]
        return prs

    def get_train_transforms(self) -> list[Callable]:

        train_transforms = [
            TTCNTransform.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]
        return train_transforms

    def get_val_transforms(self) -> list[Callable]:

        val_transforms = [
            TTCNTransform.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]

        return val_transforms

    def get_target_transform(self) -> NormalTargetTransform:
        target_transform = NormalTargetTransform.from_config(self.cfg)
        return target_transform

    def predict_sequence(self, sequence: pl.DataFrame):

        for pr in self.prs:
            sequence = pr(sequence)

        for transform in self.val_transforms:
            sequence = transform(sequence)

        model_device = next(self.model.parameters()).device

        self.model.eval()
        with torch.inference_mode():
            sequence = [x.to(model_device) for x in sequence]
            sequence = [x.unsqueeze(0) for x in sequence]
            prediction = self.model(sequence)

        return prediction

    def prediction_to_label(self, prediction):
        prediction = prediction.squeeze().argmax().item()
        return self.target_transform.label_int_to_category[prediction]


def get_giga_model(
        cfg: DictConfig,
        device: str = "cuda",
        checkpoint_path: Path = None,
) -> GigaModel:
    return GigaModel(
        cfg=cfg,
        device=device,
        checkpoint_path=checkpoint_path,
    )
```

As you can see, if I want to create a new approach,
the only thing that I need to do is to abstract from `GigaModel`
and replace only the `get_*` functions.
For example, for my `Convolutional` model, which uses `Time of flight` data,
I should write something like below:

```python
class GigaTofConv1(GigaModel):
    def __init__(
            self,
            cfg: DictConfig,
            device: str = "cuda",
            checkpoint_path: Path = None,
    ):
        super().__init__(cfg, device, checkpoint_path)

    def get_model(self) -> nn.Module:
        return TofConv1.from_config(self.cfg)

    def get_prs(self) -> list[Callable]:
        prs = [
            DropUnnecessaryColumns.from_config(self.cfg),
            DropNulls.from_config(self.cfg),
            ShrinkSequence.from_config(self.cfg),
            SortData.from_config(self.cfg),
            ChangeTOFTo2D.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]
        return prs

    def get_train_transforms(self) -> list[Callable]:
        train_transforms = [
            TOFTransform.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]
        return train_transforms

    def get_val_transforms(self) -> list[Callable]:
        val_transforms = [
            TOFTransform.from_config(self.cfg),
        ]
        return val_transforms


def get_giga_model(
        cfg: DictConfig,
        device: str = "cuda",
        checkpoint_path: Path = None,
) -> GigaModel:
    return GigaTofConv1(
        cfg=cfg,
        device=device,
        checkpoint_path=checkpoint_path,
    )
```

As shown in the code above, I have only rewritten the functions which
were needed.
The `get_giga_model` function for every approach that I make is a way to have
`dependency injection`.
The names of all functions are the same; I only change the import.

## Final thoughts

I think putting all the actions which is needed for a model to create
the result that is intended to create is a good technique.
My code is still modular, because models, preprocesses, and transforms
work separately, but they are in a `bundle` that I can use multiple times.
